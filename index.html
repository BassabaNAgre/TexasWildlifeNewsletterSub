							<p class="major">Experience the wild, wide-ranging beauty of Texas through its best state parks.
								<br>
								Despite prevailing stereotypes of Texas as some giant piece of empty, flat, lonely desert, the state actually has a lot going for it in the nature department. Yeah, you can find stretches of desert that are frankly quite beautiful, but you can also find large swatches of dense forest, strips of white sandy beaches, lush hill country, mythical-looking swamps, and even rugged mountain ranges. <br>
								One way to experience this wonderful breadth of Texan landscapes is to visit its beautiful state parks. There are more than 80 of them in total — no two are alike, except for the fact that each offers tons of fun adventures for those whose happy place is the outdoors. In no particular order, here are some of the best state parks in Texas to add to your travel bucket list.

							<h2>Palo Duro Canyon State Park</h2>
							<p>We all know that Arizona has the Grand Canyon, but not everyone knows that Texas has Palo Duro Canyon. This is the second-largest canyon in America at 120 miles long, 20 miles wide, and reaching up to 800 feet in depth. At Palo Duro Canyon State Park, you can experience the natural wonder from down low and up high along the over 30 miles of trails, taking you through rock formations striped in rich shades of orange, red, and brown.</p>

							<h2>Pedernales Falls State Park</h2>
							<p>Many people come to Pedernales Falls State Park for one particular thing: the falls the park is named after. Rather than the towering types of waterfalls you might be imagining, the falls here are a long, wide stretch in the Pedernales River where water flows over large limestone slabs, giving off some real “Land Before Time,” dinosaur-age vibes.<br> Viewing and hiking around the falls are far from the only thing to occupy your time at this state park though. There are other trails to explore, including a 10-mile one perfect for mountain bikers, spots for tubing, canoeing, and kayaking, and rugged stretches for horseback riding.</p>

							<h2>Garner State Park</h2>
							<p>Garner State Park is nestled right into a bend in the Frio River, meaning you’re free to go swimming, tubing, and paddleboating. Back on land, you have 16 miles of trails to wander with one of the favorites being the short but challenging Old Baldy Trail, which gives you an excellent view of the river canyon. <br> One of the prime times to visit Garner State Park is in the autumn, particularly early November, when you can see the area’s famous, colorful display of foliage. If you want to plan a trip then, just be sure to book your campsite far in advance since it’s likely to get packed.</p>

							<h2>More Parks</h2>
							<p>Why spend time stuck in Texas traffic when you can enjoy nature at a state park instead? <br> There are over 80 state parks in Texas, and living/visiting Texas puts you in close range of many of them. If you ever need a break from the city and all that comes with it, just hop in your car and before you know it, you could be immersed in some beautiful nature. Just have a day to spare? Don’t worry, there are great state parks an easy hour’s drive away. Have a weekend or more to play? You’ll have even more options at your fingertips.</p>

										<h3>Caddo Lake State Park</h3>
										<p>Caddo Lake State Park challenges many peoples’ idea of what a state park looks like with its swampy landscape that visitors can navigate by canoe or kayak. Anyone who doubts how beautiful a swamp can be will quickly change their mind as they paddle through these bayous with bald cypress trees shrouded in Spanish moss.</p>

										<h3>Brazos Bend State Park</h3>
										<p>Brazos Bend State Park might just be an hour’s drive outside of Houston, but it feels far more removed from the busy metropolis thanks to its 5,000 acres of varied terrain. There are prairies, woodlands, and wetlands, and living among that are a diverse array of species, including river otters, alligators, and hundreds of different birds.</p>

										<h3>Monahans Sandhills State Park</h3>
										<p>Another state park you shouldn’t miss in West Texas is Monahans Sandhills State Park.

The state park has over 3,800 acres of sand dunes.</p>

										<h3>Colorado Bend State Park</h3>

										<p>Did you know that the second-largest canyon in the country is actually in Texas? It’s Palo Duro Canyon in the Texas Panhandle, and not too far from there, there’s another one at Caprock Canyons State Park. The drive between the two spots is referred to as the Canyon Sweep, and there are actually a few different routes you can take.</p>
